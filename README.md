# pyweather
weather info from weather underground with python

speak_weather.py will speak weather info from Weather Underground with a free API key. Festival is used for the speech output. This runs from a cron job in the mornings. Some of the common data points are pulled out. Just create a custom message to send to the speech process. 

scrape_weather.py just scrapes the hi and lo and prints. Just an example of BeautifulSoup..
